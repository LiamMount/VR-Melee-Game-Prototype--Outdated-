# VR Melee Game Prototype - Outdated
 A game I made to test more VR stuff, and sadly no longer works.
 
 It was meant to emulate the mechanics from Space Pirate Trainer's Brawler weapon. I wound up being semi-successful. I cannot guarantee this project being able to run anymore, due to Unity updating.
